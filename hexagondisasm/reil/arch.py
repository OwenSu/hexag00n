"""Hexagon architecture definition.

This module was copied from BARF (``barf/arch/arch.py``). It will be used to integrate
the Hexagon to REIL translator with the BARF framework implementing the methods
defined in ``ArchitectureInformation`` (without those, an ``NotImplementedError``
exception is raised).

Todo:
    * Should constants like `ARCH_HEXAGON` be added to BARF's `arch.py`? Hexagon
        won't be fully integrated with BARF, it will use is as a library.

    * Normally, in this same module the instruction object is defined (e.g.,
        ``ArmInstruction`` for ARM). The `HexagonInstruction` is already
        defined (in the `common.py` module). How can that be signaled here?
