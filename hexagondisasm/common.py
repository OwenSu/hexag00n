    An encoding field can be characterized with only a mask (int) with the 1's set
    to indicate the positions of the field chars in the encoding. E.g., in the encoding
    (str) ``1011iiiiiiisssssPPiiiiiiiiiddddd``, the field ``s5`` would have a mask
    (int) like ``0b00000000000111110000000000000000``.

    This mask is used to later extract the value of the field in the instruction
    being disassembled, which would be used to generate either an immediate or
    register operand.

    This value extraction (bit by bit) can be time consuming. To improve performance,
    and taking advantage of the fact that most encoding fields are unified, (i.e.,
    all their field chars have consecutive order, like the example above), other
    (redundant) attributes are added to the class to reflect this.
    If a field is unified (``no_mask_split`` is True), the field value can
    be extracted just by applying a logical and operation, if the mask is split,
    after the logical and, the extracted bits need to be joined (which is time consumig
    for the disassembly process, as seen in the profiling results).

    Attributes:

        mask (int): resulting from setting to 1's the positions in the instruction encoding

            number of 1's in the mask).
        no_mask_split (bool): indicates whether all the field chars have a consecutive
            bit ordering (i.e., if all the 1's in the mask are together).
        mask_lower_pos (int): lowest bit index in the encoding where the field char is found
